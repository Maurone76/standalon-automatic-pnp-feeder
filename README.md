Design of a fully autonomous pick and place feeder,
useful for adding Chinese-made benchtop pick and place power supplies (e.g. tvm802) and for DIY projects such as OpenPnP and more.

Mechanics composed of printable parts with a 3d printer, it works with a small SG90 type servomotor and controlled by a board 
with a small ATtiny45 microcontroller.
Programmable progress via button and trimmer. 
Very simple to assemble and set up.
